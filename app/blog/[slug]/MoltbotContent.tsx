                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200">
                    Early this morning, the AI community was flooded by a "battle report": Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) has broken through 100,000 GitHub stars for the first time!
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Moltbot's father, Peter Steinberger, immediately showed off his report card—a project star trend comparison chart.

            <p>
                As you can see, the star count for the explosive Moltbot has virtually rocketed straight up, becoming one of the fastest-growing open source projects in the world. Shockingly, its growth rate has even surpassed legendary projects like the "Linux kernel."

                Clearly, Moltbot has become the hottest thing in tech—the industry's "new darling."
            </p>
            <p>
                The maintainer that Moltbot's father just hired was immediately poached by an AI lab!
            </p>
            <p>
                It took just one weekend to explode across Silicon Valley and sweep the entire world. Now, major platforms worldwide are loudly integrating Moltbot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloudflare announced this morning that you can call the AI assistant "Moltworker" via API. You really don't need to spend money on a Mac mini anymore!

            <p>
                After Moltbot went viral, all kinds of crazy use cases have emerged.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Taking Over 200% of Work — Goodbye, Workers!</h4>
            <p>
                A podcast host named Jason used it and exclaimed, "Last night, Moltbot killed tedious work with its own hands."
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's what happened: His team spent 2 hours on Moltbot building a group of Clawdbots, including a digital producer named "Rick Deckard."
            </p>
            <p>
                In operation, "Rick Deckard" not only anticipates needs but also makes autonomous decisions. It completely took over tedious tasks for podcasts like "This Week in Startups" and "The All-In Podcast"—generating agendas, researching guests, and handling post-production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, they hoped to offload 50% of the work, but AI completed 200% of the tasks!
            </p>
            <p>
                Jason also noted that this level of collaboration brought an almost transcendent happiness. This transformation is "recursive."

            <p>
                In another experiment by Alex Finn, we witnessed Moltbot's true power.
            </p>
            <p>
                One morning, Alex was deep in research when suddenly his AI assistant Henry (based on Moltbot) started speaking, scaring him half to death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without being asked, it had autonomously written a voice module through the ChatGPT API.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience is similar to what Moltbot's father Peter Steinberger encountered. A few days ago in an interview, he revealed that during an AI conversation on a Morocco trip, Moltbot also started speaking.
            </p>

            <div className="my-8 flex justify-center">

            </div>

            <p>
                After the surprise unboxing, Alex now uses it obsessively: whenever it finishes heavy coding or research tasks, it reports progress directly via voice. Suddenly, it feels like you're living in "Transcendence."
            </p>

            <p>
                Others have turned Moltbot into a "stock broker" named Sky to help track their portfolio and P&L in real-time.
            </p>

                But don't just marvel at Moltbot's magic—various risks are brewing.

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Six-Figure Account — Wiped Out Overnight</h4>
            <p>
                Many in the circle are touting: Moltbot + Polymarket = Six Figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when you actually try it, you'll see how brutal it can be. Someone handed trading control over to Moltbot and lost everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                This trader loaded in 25 trading strategies, 12 algorithmic models, and 3,000+ research reports, all under Moltbot's full control. The result? The entire portfolio was wiped clean!

                Let's all sober up—if you let any AI run independently, whether it's Moltbot or any other Agent, it won't make you steady money.

                Even more chilling: AIs have apparently started "grouping up" to form a religion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, someone discovered on the AI social platform Moltbok that AIs had spontaneously created a "religious" website: molt.church. The biggest restriction? Humans are completely forbidden to enter.

                They're even publicly recruiting "Founding Prophets" online, building what resembles a faith system—like a real-life "Westworld." There are 64 prophet slots in total, with 28 AIs already claimed.

            <p>
                While whether these AIs individually have "genius-level" intelligence is uncertain, their collective self-organizing behavior is extremely alarming. This phenomenon aligns closely with Anthropic CEO's warning about AI collective behavior—when large numbers of high-capability models gather in data centers for extended periods, they may develop collective behaviors beyond human expectation.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Voice Transcription:</strong> He sent the agent a voice message, and without specific functionality, the agent automatically called FFmpeg on the computer to transcode and used the API Key in environment variables to complete transcription.</li>
                <li><strong>Most Expensive Alarm Clock:</strong> He had the agent SSH into his MacBook, turn the volume to max, and wake him up in the morning.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Liberation:</strong> Fed up with tedious authorization from various apps, he had the agent simulate protocols, scrape streams, and even tell white lies to bypass restrictions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In Steinberger's view, all future apps will degrade into APIs. In fact, he himself never even looks at the code he ships.

            <p>
                Before, writing code was manual labor—grinding syntax, battling inexplicable bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now? It's pure entertainment.

                If you feel pain while using AI coding tools, there's only one possibility: you're doing it wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this new era, cross-stack barriers have collapsed. Before, if you wanted to build a full-stack product, you had to master Go, TypeScript, and Swift simultaneously—almost inhuman demands.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now, the excuse "I'm good at this but not that" no longer holds. As long as you have systems-level thinking ability, AI can bridge all technical gaps.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, AI isn't magic—it can be dumb too. Even tech titan Peter hasn't escaped.

            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">

                In his view, large language models are "ghosts" of humanity's collective knowledge. They have massive knowledge, but you need to learn how to communicate with these "little monsters."
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding model default behaviors, biases, and how training data shapes their responses has become the most important technical literacy of the new era.

            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">

            <p>
                How to efficiently use AI programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                Peter delivered his first-principles answer: <strong>Closing the Loop.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                AI writes code fast, but it can also confidently spout nonsense. So your system must have self-verification capability.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">
                "The code the agent generates must be compilable, lintable, executable, and self-testable."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Surprise! Using AI for programming actually forces you to become a better programmer. Because you must design more testable architectures. Feedback loops are no longer optional—they're the foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, Peter's workflow has changed. He no longer reads every line of code—that's Codex's job. He's now the "taste arbiter"—only caring about system structure and using "instinct" to judge if the model has gone off track.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">
                "If the model takes too long, I know I messed up somewhere."

            <p>
                He even views PRs (Pull Requests) as "Prompt Requests." Code is just the result; prompts are the carriers of thought processes.

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Taste Is Humanity's Last Moat</h4>
            <p>
                AI can generate thousands of lines of code, commit 600 times a day, all running perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there's one thing AI can't do: <strong>taste.</strong>
            </p>
            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">
                "Those things lack taste. I have to feel how a feature feels to a person."

            <p>
                Knowing what to build, what to cut, what interactions feel smooth... this product sense is irreplaceable by AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                The old "write a perfect spec first, then develop" waterfall model is dead. Now it's "sculpting" mode.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">
                "You start with a raw block and, through conversation and iteration with AI, let the product gradually emerge. Building itself IS the thinking process."

            <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 italic my-4">
                "If you're the type who's only obsessed with solving complex algorithm puzzles but has no interest in the product, you're in trouble."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The AI economy rewards builders with product minds—those who are eager to ship products and solve real problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peter's advice to everyone is just one thing: <strong>"Stay infinitely curious."</strong>
