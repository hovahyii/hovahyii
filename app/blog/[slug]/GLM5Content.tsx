                    Late on February 7th, a mysterious model codenamed "Pony Alpha" quietly went online. Throw in some "spaghetti code" that took a day to fix, and it refactors the architecture effortlessly; input a simple prompt, and it spits out a complete Web App with 35 radio stations and a silky-smooth UI.

            <p>
                If Claude Opus represented the peak of closed-source models, then the release of GLM-5 undoubtedly marks the arrival of the "Opus Moment" for domestic open-source models.

            <p>
                To verify GLM-5's engineering limit, a senior developer decided to play it big:
            </p>
            <p>
                Hand-rubbing an AI programming assistant with a desktop UI from scratch——GLMLIFE.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is equivalent to making a simple version of Cursor.
            </p>

            <div className="my-8 flex justify-center">

            </div>

            <p>
                After throwing the task to GLM-5, it didn't start writing code frantically but first threw out a professional architecture design document (PLAN.md) and made extremely mature technology choices:
            </p>
            <p>
                It directly adopted the Monorepo architecture and precisely disassembled the project into three core packages.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> Responsible for Agent core engine and LLM adaptation;</li>

                <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> Desktop main program based on Electron + React 18.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <p>
                From Zustand state management to Tailwind style schemes, and then to complex IPC process communication, GLM-5 is like a technical director with ten years of team experience, arranging technical choices clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The developer originally thought it would take three days to configure the environment, but it only took one day to run through the entire process from environment setup, core logic implementation to Electron packaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opening GLMLIFE, it's hard to believe this is a product "architected" by AI in one day.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Why Can It Become the "Opus of the Open Source World"?</h3>
            <p>
                Looking globally, Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex are sought after because they possess extremely strong "architectural" capabilities.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Opus 4.6's Brute Force Aesthetics:</strong> 16 AI avatars autonomously divided labor, taking two weeks to build a Rust compiler containing 100,000 lines of code from scratch, passing 99% of GCC stress tests.</li>
                <li><strong>GPT-5.3's Self-Creation:</strong> It is OpenAI's first model to "participate in its own creation," intervening in the training process and cluster deployment before "birth."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, all this has a fatal premise: they are not only closed-source but also expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this moment, the release of GLM-5 is a violent breakthrough by Chinese open-source large models for the Agentic era.
            </p>
            <p>
                It stares directly at the field that closed-source giants least want to let go of——system-level engineering capabilities——and launches a "replacement-style" attack.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">1. New "Backend Architect"</h4>
            <p>
                The Zhipu team knows very well that the open-source world does not lack models that can write Python scripts; what it lacks is models that can handle dirty work, tiring work, and big work.
            </p>
            <p>
                GLM-5 has significantly strengthened the weight of backend architecture design, complex algorithm implementation, and stubborn Bug fixing in training, and also achieved a strong self-reflection mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                When compilation fails, it will analyze logs, locate root causes, modify code, and recompile like a mature engineer until the system runs.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">2. Since It's Work, Do the Math</h4>
            <p>
                Performance comparable to Opus, combined with open-source weights, allows GLM-5 to shake the walled gardens built by Anthropic and OpenAI to some extent.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Local Deployment:</strong> It can run not only on a completely isolated intranet but also be fine-tuned for the company's private framework, becoming the specialist who knows its own code best.</li>
                <li><strong>Controllable Cost:</strong> Users can run a powerful Coding Agent on a consumer-grade graphics card cluster without feeling the pinch every time they run a test.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Dominating SOTA Leaderboards</h3>
            <p>
                GLM-5's evolution can only be described in one word: brutal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since it is a base model designed for complex system engineering, the scale must be maxed out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The parameter count went from 355B (active 32B) straight to 744B (active 40B), and pre-training data piled up from 23T to 28.5T.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides being "big," it also has to be "thrifty."
            </p>
            <p>
                As everyone knows, the most expensive thing about running an Agent is Tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this pain point, GLM-5 integrated the DeepSeek Sparse Attention mechanism for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows it to maintain "lossless" memory while handling ultra-long contexts, while significantly reducing deployment costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's an even more ruthless "black technology"——the brand new asynchronous reinforcement learning framework Slime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combined with large-scale reinforcement learning, the model is no longer a "one-time tool" but a "long-distance runner" that gets smarter as it runs.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for benchmarks, it's hardcore:
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">Code Ability</p>
            <p>
                SWE-bench Verified shot straight to 77.8 points, Terminal Bench 2.0 took 56.2 points in one fell swoop, both No. 1 in open source. This score not only surpassed Gemini 3.0 Pro but also sticks right to Claude Opus 4.5's face.
            </p>

                Most interesting is Vending Bench 2 (vending machine operation test).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this test, the model has to rely entirely on itself to operate a vending machine for a year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guess what, GLM-5 actually earned $4432 by the end of the year, a level almost catching up with Opus 4.5.

            </p>
            <p>
                The real usage feel is already approaching Opus 4.5.

            <p>
                Of course, GLM-5's ambition is not limited to models, but lies in restructuring the programming tools in our hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                The globally popular OpenClaw has shown everyone the potential of AI operating computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, Zhipu also launched the AutoGLM version of OpenClaw.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using the original version, just environment configuration took half a day, now the official website has one-click deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Want a "digital intern" to watch Twitter, organize news, or even write scripts for you 24x7? Click and you have it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also released is Z Code——
            </p>
            <p>
                A new generation development tool born completely based on GLM-5 capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Z Code, you just make requests, the model automatically disassembles tasks, and even pulls up a bunch of Agents to work concurrently: writing code, running commands, Debugging, previewing, and finally even handling Git submissions for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even more, you can use your mobile phone to remotely command the desktop Agent to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is worth mentioning that, just like OpenAI used Codex to write Codex, Z Code itself was also developed with the full participation of GLM models.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Victory of Domestic Computing Power</h3>
            <p>
                Behind GLM igniting global traffic and the surge in Agent demand, a group of "unsung heroes" are silently supporting massive computing loads.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure every line of code and every Agent plan outputs stably, GLM-5 has gone deep into the "hinterland" of domestic computing power, completing deep adaptation with mainstream platforms like Huawei Ascend, Moore Threads, Cambricon, Kunlunxin, MetaX, Enflame, and Haiguang.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through refined optimization at the underlying operator level, GLM-5 can also run "high throughput, low latency" full-blooded performance on domestic chip clusters.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means we not only have top-tier models but are also not being choked.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In the spring of 2026, large programming models finally shed their childishness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karpathy's so-called "Agentic Engineering" is essentially a stricter "interview requirement" for AI:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Previously (Vibe Coding):</strong> As long as you can write beautiful HTML, I'll hire you.</li>
                <li><strong>Now (Agentic Coding):</strong> You need to understand the Linux kernel, understand the call relationships between 500 microservices, know how to refactor code without blowing up production, and be able to plan tasks and fix bugs yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                GLM-5 is not perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
                But on the core proposition of "building complex systems," it is currently the only player in the open-source world that can catch this "Agentic Wave."
            </p>
            <p>
                Vibe Coding is over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stop asking AI "Can you help me write a webpage?" That was a 2025 thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, try asking it: "Can you help me refactor the core module of this high-concurrency system?"
